# Salesforce Revenue Insight ‚Äì Dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS)

### üìä Project Overview  
This project demonstrates an enterprise-grade Power BI dashboard built using **Salesforce opportunity and account data**.  
It provides actionable insights on revenue, deal size, and win rates while implementing **Dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS)** to ensure users see only data relevant to their access level.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Highlights  
- **Dynamic RLS:** Implemented using `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` for user-based filtering.  
- **Composite Security Logic:** Combined `Account Type` + `Industry` into a single key (`CombinedKey`) to control multi-field RLS access.  
- **Optimized Data Modeling:** Managed *many-to-many* relationships with controlled cross-filter direction to avoid ambiguity.  
- **KPIs Included:**  
  - Total Revenue ($)  
  - Win Rate %  
  - Average Deal Size ($)  
  - Forecasted Pipeline Revenue ($)  
- **Deployed as Power BI App:** Packaged and published to Power BI Service for secure sharing and access management.
